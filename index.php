          <p>Alcoholics Anonymous is a fellowship of men and women who share their experience,
          strength and hope with each other that they may solve their common problem
          and help others to recover from alcoholism. The only requirement for membership
          is a desire to stop drinking. There are no dues or fees for AA membership;
          we are self-supporting through our own contributions. AA is not allied
          with any sect, denomination, politics, organization or institution; does
          not wish to engage in any controversy, neither endorses nor opposes any
          causes. Our primary purpose is to stay sober and help other alcoholics
          to achieve sobriety</p>
